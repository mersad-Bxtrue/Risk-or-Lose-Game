# Risk-or-Lose-Game
🏆a game that can increase the risk-taking stress in you at any moment.


Game rules:

✅The game starts with player 1 and starts rolling the dice. He can continue to roll the dice and two things can happen:
1) keep the points he got and give the dice to the opponent.
2) If he gets a number 1 between his dice throws, all the points he got in the current score will be zero and the dice will be wasted.
✅Whoever reaches the number 100 first wins the game and can leave a message for his opponent
✅The game can start from the beginning, but this time it starts with the person who won the game in the last hand
