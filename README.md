🏆 In this game, the winner is the one who has high risk-taking power and can get the most points when the dice are in her hands.
However, you should be careful that your dice are not number 1, because in this case you will lose everything. 🫡

# Rules of the game:

✅ The game starts with player 1 and starts rolling the dice. You can keep rolling the dice and two things can happen:
1) Keep the points you have earned and give the dice to your opponent.
2) If you roll a 1 between your dice rolls, all the points you have earned in the current score will be zero and the dice will be lost.

✅ Whoever reaches the number 100 first wins the game and can leave a message for his opponent.

✅ The game can start from the beginning, but this time it starts with the person who won the last hand.
