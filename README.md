# Rules of the game:

✅ The game starts with player 1 and starts rolling the dice. You can keep rolling the dice and two things can happen:
1) Keep the points you have earned and give the dice to your opponent.
2) If you roll a 1 between your dice rolls, all the points you have earned in the current score will be zero and the dice will be lost.

✅ Whoever reaches the number 100 first wins the game and can leave a message for his opponent.

✅ The game can start from the beginning, but this time it starts with the person who won the last hand.
